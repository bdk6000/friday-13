> > Hey everyone!

I hope you are enjoying the new patch which includes a large number of bug fixes and new content!

We know we likely didn't fix everything that you feel is wrong with the game and we likely have new issues with the new content. I assure you we are doing our best to address the major issues as quick as possible as well as adding in new things for people to enjoy. The last few months have been hectic.

You can always submit bugs to the www.jasonkillsbugs.com website when you find them. We also are regularly in the F13 Discord channel and we monitor the forums for bug reports. If you post them there its likely we have seen the issue and have it logged.

Rather than leave you with the ra-ra speech I want to take a moment to break down some of the long term issues, new things we know about, and then how we are moving forward with getting them fixed for you.
Moving Forward

We have learned a lot over the last few months of being live and we have made the decision to move out a few items that were not listed in the road map to ensure we get better testing on the new content and allow time for developers to fix long standing bugs

Standing Major Issues

The Car/Boat

The vehicles are a mess. Its a physics driven object that players are able to freely drive around the map and in some cases interactions with other objects cause disastrous issues. To fix this we are moving our engine up to a newer version that includes a number of fixes to the physics systems and then from there we are going to hammer away at whatever remains. What we didn't want to do is fix the issues once and then have to fix them again as we implemented the new version of the engine so there has been a delay in getting everything wrapped up.

Integrating a new version of the engine is not insignificant. It requires us to isolate the game, see whats broken, and fix it all. It is then merged into our main development branch for everyone to start working from. Right now we are a few weeks away from being able to start working with the new version, from there we will have someone dedicated to fixing vehicle issues until the car and boat are in a better state.

Performance

Along with the Physics fixes mentioned above. The new version of the engine has a number of performance fixes, optimizations, and upgrades the game to DX12. 

Perks

Over the last few patches we have fixed up a number of issues with Perks but I know there are a few still out there. Please let us know if you find anything else, we are looking into them all internal and fixing things as we find them.

Environmental Kills

There are a lot of kills placed all over the maps. We are doing an audit on all maps but it takes time to launch a game and move to each one to initiate a kill and make sure it works. If you know of a location that a kill is broken at let us know.

Jason not Receiving XP if the Counselor Disconnects

This will be fixed in the next patch.

Duplicate Tapes

This will be fixed in the next patch.

Jason and Counselor Interactions

Grabs, characters intersecting with one another and becoming stuck, Jason smashing the car, flying counselors, Jason being able to destroy objects while holding counselors, etc.

We are moving a few minor improvements that are new features out to have someone dedicated to fixing these issues over the next month or so.

New Issues

The below items are all fixed in the next patch or expected to be fixed
Spectators Dont See Rain
Jarvis House Stuck Spots
Boat Repair Location Doesnt Work on the Left Side of the Boat
Police Voice Queue After Calling The Police
If you run across any new issues please use the social channels mentioned above to get that info to us so we can get them fixed.

Thanks for your ears and I appreciate you reading through this post.
