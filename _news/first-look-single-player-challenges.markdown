Hey everyone!

Today we would like to share some news about the Single Player Challenges we are introducing to Friday the 13th: The Game. This game mode will not require any additional purchase and will be bundled in its entirety with the engine upgrade patch.

In Single Player Challenges, players will control Jason and hunt down counselors in multiple movie-like scenarios. Here are some of the features that you can expect to see:

Multiple replayable missions across varied locations, featuring numerous individual objectives
Unique scenarios and maps specially tailored for each mission
Cinematic Kills only available in SP Challenges
New voice acting and responsive AI that tells a new story in each map
Weâ€™re very excited for everyone to experience our Single Player Challenges!

Let us know what you think!
