Today we are excited to talk about one of the new changes coming with our next update; an increase in max player level from 101 to 150. This increase won’t just be a number that keeps getting higher as you play more and earn XP. There are some cool things that you will unlock along the way, and we’re going to talk about a few of those right now.

New for Counselors: More clothing coloring options for Mitch, Fox… and a couple more counselors that we aren’t ready to speak about, yet… allowing you to stand out from the other prey in the match.

New for Jason: get ready to murder pesky counselors in new ways. In the upcoming patch you will be able to unlock two brand-spankin’ new grab kills for Jason, absolutely for free. Well, except for the cost of CP. We’ll also have bloody variations of multiple Jasons allowing you to walk around splattered with blood like the slasher you are.

That’s not all, though. More level rewards will be added in the coming months, and we’ll have more information about them in the coming months.
