Good afternoon, counselors!

Today is all about Perks, and the first thing we want to talk about is a slight reworking of the UI which is designed to help players who live with certain types of color blindness. Each perk, as well as the Perk Legend, will include a numerical value of 1 through 6 as a visual indicator of Perk rarity. 1 being for Poor Perks, while 6 will denote Legendary Perks (more on that later in this post).

Next up, let’s share some value changes that we are making to Perks.

Easy Listening – Radio proximity recharge rate boost:

Old Value: 1-10%
New Value: 10-40%
 Motorboating – Boat movement speed increase

Old Value: 1-15%
New Value: 5-35%
Man at Arms – Weapon durability increase

Old Value: 5-25%
New Value: 5-15%
 My Dads a Cop – Cop arrival time reduction

Old Value: -5 - -30%
New Value: -5 - -25%
 Quiet Swimmer – Sense detection chance reduction

Old Value: 1-25%
New Value: 5-20%
 Lead Foot – Car speed increase

Old Value: 1-10%
New Value: 5-20%
Aquanaut – Swimming speed increase

Old Value: 1-15%
New Value: 5-35%
Finally, we would like to introduce Legendary Perks. Legendary Perks have all the benefits of the Perks that you know and love, but they also include a Legendary Stat Bonus. A Legendary Stat Bonus is a small value increase to a predetermined stat.

For example: You could roll a Legendary Lead Foot Perk with +19 Car Driving Speed, -2 Boat Driving Speed, with a bonus of +4 Car Start Speed.

Or:

You could roll a Legendary Medic Perk with 2 Med Spray uses, an +8 Health Increase, +5 incoming attack damage, with a +3 to Repair Speed.

We’ll release a full listing of Legendary Bonus Stats a little closer to when the next update releases.

Please let us know what you think!
