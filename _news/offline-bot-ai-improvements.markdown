Hello Camp Slashers,

We’ve talked about grab animations, Single Player Challenges, Weapon Switching, Changes to Part 7 Jason, Grab Animation reworking, Roy’s Coveralls, the Salt Mines, and Key-binding, and today we’re going to talk about some of the improvements coming to the counselor AI in Friday the 13th: The Game’s Offline Bots game mode.

AI will now be equipped with Perks that better match the selected difficulty level. Playing on Hard? The counselors might be packing a Perk that starts them out with a defensive item, just like their human counterparts.
AI will be better at choosing a hiding spot, and what cabins they should enter based on the number of other counselors in the cabin.
At higher difficulties, counselors will more carefully select and use weapons, especially weighing their chance to stun. They’ll probably ditch that stick for something that packs a bit more punch.
AI might not be able to appreciate music, but higher difficulty AI will use the radios located in the cabins as a means of distraction.
Higher difficulty AI can shoot more accurately, place traps, and will attempt to open Jason’s traps with pocket knives.
They have become better at repairing vehicles and letting friends into a repaired car before they take off, as well as getting back onto the road in case they wreck.
Counselors will react more realistically to sounds – broken windows, doors, walls – and depending on difficulty and the counselor you snatch up, they may have an easier time of breaking free of Jason’s grasp.
We believe that these changes will allow our Jason players to face a greater challenge against the Offline Bot AI.
