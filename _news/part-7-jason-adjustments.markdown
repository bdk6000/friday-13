We’ve seen a ton of feedback for a while now about Part 7 Jason being “underpowered” or “weak”, and while we agree that maybe his stats aren’t the best to encourage play over some of the other Jasons, we are not planning a complete reworking of the character. 

Even though we aren’t completely reworking the character, we do believe that a couple of tweaks to this character’s strengths and weaknesses will make for a better play experience:

The following changes will be made to Part 7 Jason:

Change 1: We are replacing +Grip Strength with +Weapon Strength. This will help to make Jason’s slashes more harmful to counselors.

Change 2: We are replacing -Shift with -Stun. This change will allow for more mobility by Jason.

We believe that these changes will increase the viability of selecting Part 7 Jason.
