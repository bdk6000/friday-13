Want faster matches? Maybe you want to start a match with just a few friends and not a full match of 8 players. You're in luck. We took the classic Higgins, Packanack and Crystal Lake Maps and resized them. New loot locations, vehicle spawns and escape locations. Get ready for fast-paced, machete swinging fun! 

We started the production of these maps 2 months before the game launched. Creating new maps is a very long process. It takes months and months to layout the level, create new assets, spawn points (players, items, buildings, cars, etc) and work on the lighting. Then we have to balance each level. Balancing takes the longest to get dialed in just right. We have to look at counselor stats, like stamina, to adjust the distance between cabins. You can't just stick cabins/camps just anywhere. If these aren't properly balanced, then you have counselors either running out of stamina long before they are close enough to a structure, or you have players that can run from building to building without losing stamina. But that's where these smaller maps become really, really interesting.

We kept all the counselor stats and Jason abilities (and cooldowns) the same. But that's about where the similarities end. We didn't simply shrink the map and call it a day. We rebalanced for the smaller map, changed up spawner locations, changed where the parts and cars are, as well as cabins and camps. You'll still find the bigger structures in familiar locations, but don't get too comfy. Smaller maps might mean you don't have to hunt long to find an item, but it also means Jason has a smaller area to hunt you.
