Hello campers,

As promised, I wanted to give you an update on the current status of Paranoia. Our goal with this game mode has always been to create a different experience compared to the traditional multiplayer F13 mode. We want it to be unique, scary, and offer a new kind of challenge for players. We began working on an internal prototype late last summer (2017), and started playing together (ILL + GUN) weekly. The point of the prototype was to test theories and ideas within the paper design doc for Paranoia. Do these ideas work? Is it unique and challenging? Most importantly - is it fun? To put it bluntly: it isn’t fun enough. 

We unanimously agreed, after weeks of playing together, that there’s something there...a glimmer of a very fun game mode. But it needs to stay in the oven longer. We need to keep throwing around ideas, mechanics and features to find the missing piece. But our teams were faced with hurdles to overcome, some greater than others. 

While we would have liked to go head down and keep pushing Paranoia, this would've required us to set aside the work towards dedicated servers, as Paranoia would've needed the full team. I had to make a decision, and focusing on dedicated servers and new content, feels like the best decision we could make. We have some ideas on what will make Paranoia what we want it to be, but until we launch and perfect dedicated servers, I made the call to hold on all forward movement with Paranoia.

I’m sure that this is not the news that you were wanting to hear, but I think it’s the best call and it was mine to make. I always strive to steer this ship to the best of my ability. What I don’t want to do is launch a game mode that is “just ok”. We don’t get out of bed everyday to produce an average product. Once we are finished with dedicated servers, we will return our focus to Paranoia to continue tinkering to find the fun. If we never find it, then I will make the call to completely cancel it. Again, I don’t want to give you content that doesn’t live up to the standards we have tried to deliver throughout this journey together. You not only deserve better than that, you also deserve this type of transparency, and I intend on delivering both to you. I would also like to thank you all for your patience, and for the overwhelming support and passion you have for this game. We will continue to push to make this the best F13 experience we can, and we look forward to seeing you all at camp.
