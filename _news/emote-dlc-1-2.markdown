Dying to talk to players, but don't have a mic? Perhaps Jason is near and you want to remain quiet, yet communicate with a nearby player? Good news... 

We're adding 8 free communication emotes along with a fancy new in-game HUD/UI. Players will be able to select emotes per counselor and assign them to our new in-game UI. Now you can wave at Jason...just before he kills you.
