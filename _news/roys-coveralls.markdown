This one goes out to all of you Roy fans. After the release of Roy and Pinehurst, we saw large conversations about the color of Roy’s overalls. 
 
“Roy’s coveralls are green, but these are blue”
 
“They are blue, look at this screenshot”
 
“They are green, look at THIS screenshot”
 
And back and forth it went for days. With no end to the debate in sight, I asked Ronnie what the actual color was, and he let me know that there were ongoing conversations about that exact topic, and that the blue coveralls were not the only color we planned on Roy having.
 
Ronnie had been working with the team at IllFonic in creating mock ups of Roy to find the shade of green that matched multiple scenes from Friday the 13th: Part V. Apparently, Ronnie had spent quite a bit of time tracking down experts, memorabilia owners, and costumers to find the right shade. As it turns out, that’s not an easy thing to do. 
 
With responses from contacts of “cool grey” and “blue with green tones”, he was left without an actual definable color. Ronnie followed up on a lead of “spruce green”, and what he found is that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of colors named “spruce green”, and that they vary substantially.
 
After weeks of digging for info, tracking down colors, and mock up iterations with an artist, we have settled on the following color.

Is this color going to be a perfect match for every scene in Friday the 13th: Part V? No, but it is very close. 
 
Friday the 13th: The Game will include both blue and green coverall options for Roy - green being the default, and blue being a secondary option - for everyone's favorite paramedic in the next update.
