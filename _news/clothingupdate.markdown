**Counselor Clothing Update**

With the new Counselor Clothing Update, players will have much more control over what they want to wear as a Counselor. Our old clothing system was pretty limited, only allowing you to choose between various material and color options for the default pieces of clothing available on each Counselor. We understand that as Counselors you want to look your best, so we have been hard at work on a full revamp of the clothing system, which now provides much more control and customization. This revamp includes a new, streamlined clothing user interface (we know the old one was pretty clunky, sorry about that!), and behind the scenes, involves a system for swapping in and out skin masks and clothing meshes. What this means for you as a player is that you will be able to choose brand new outfits in addition to the default ones, and also customize the look of each piece of clothing within each outfit. To pick out your new threads, go to the customize screen for your favorite Counselor (Chad, obviously) and select Customize Clothing. Pick the outfit you would like to customize.

Finally, pick the color/pattern swatch that you want on that piece of clothing.

The new Spring Break '84 Clothing Pack DLC will also be available along with this new update, and we have a lot more fun outfits coming down the pipe soon. So suit up, customize your look, and show Camp Crystal Lake what you got!
