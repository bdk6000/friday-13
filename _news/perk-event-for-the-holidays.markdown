Starting on December 18th and lasting through to the 23rd, your chances of rolling a Rare and Epic perk will be increased. Our advice, hoard that CP you collect over the weekend and spend it next week instead.

Starting on December 23rd and running through to the 27th, your chances of finding BOTH Pamela and Jarvis tapes will be increased. If youâ€™re rummaging through drawers and find one, maybe go ahead and be a Chad and keep it for yourself.

Finally, from December 23rd and running through to January 2nd, you will be earning DOUBLE CP. Please note that CP earned from leveling up is NOT doubled, but everything else is.
