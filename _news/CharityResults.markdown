We're happy to announce that Gun Media and StackUp.org were able to come together for veterans and raise over $5,600 for charity! In partnership with several content creators, we hosted a 24-hour charity stream that goes to support veterans and those currently deployed!

A big thanks to the following for their help with the stream and to those that donated! Your contributions were invaluable for this holiday season!
