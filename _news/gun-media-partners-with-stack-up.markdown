subtitle: Charity Event to raise funds for the troops!

Hey all!  Got some cool news and something very dear to us here at Gun Media. We believe strongly in supporting those that sacrifice for all of us to be able to sit back and enjoy some quality video gaming time. To that extent, we're happy to announce that we're going to partner with Stack Up, a veteran-owned and operated charity that is dedicated to helping those deployed and those back home who need our help.

### The Plan

Starting Friday, Oct. 13th at 12:01AM EST, Stack Up invites everyone to work together in a 24-hour stream event to raise funds so that more games, more support and more community to active and retired vets can enjoy video games and the togetherness that it brings. 

### 24-Hour Charity Stream event

* START: Friday, October 13th - 12:01AM EST
* END: Friday, October 13th - 11:59PM EST
*Gun Media is proud to announce that we will match up to $3,000 in donations from our community in an effort to support this charity!*
