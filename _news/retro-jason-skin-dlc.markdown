We celebrated our one month anniversary with a free DLC Skin of Retro Jason. All free of course. Ki-Ki-Ma-Ma-Bleep-Bloop.

UPDATE

We're going to be removing Retro Jason for a little TLC work. Don't freak out, it will only be a month or so. We have some plans for this Jason, as we will be adding new music that both the counselor AND Jason hear during gameplay. And trust us, you'll like the results.
