Offline Bots work very similar to a multiplayer match, except you can play it without an internet connection. You can only play alone, meaning you can not invite your friends to play co-op. Also, you can only play as Jason in this mode. There’s a few reasons why you can only play as Jason, with the number one being the programming needed for believable Jason AI. We’ve all seen/experienced bad AI, and the last thing we wanted was to see Jason walking non-stop into a wall and not chasing you. That’s not fun, nor is it scary.

Plus we saw a lot of frustrated players that just wanted to be Jason, whenever they wanted to...without having to deal with people yelling over mics, or even worse, getting chosen to be Jason only to have the host quit out. That sucks. Luckily dedicated servers will fix this issue. Lastly, playing as Jason when you choose can really help you hone your Jason skills, which in return, actually helps you become a better counselor when you think about it.
