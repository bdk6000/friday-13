LEXINGTON, KENTUCKY July 17, 2018
Gun Media and Nighthawk Interactive are happy to announce two special physical editions of Friday the 13th: The Game. Ultimate Slasher Edition, which includes Friday the 13th: The Game and all available premium DLC*, as well as a Limited Edition poster, and the Ultimate Slasher Collector’s Edition, which includes everything from the Ultimate Slasher Edition, as well as a NECA Friday the 13th Part 3 Jason mask replica.

We take pride in providing our fans with the most screen accurate collectibles on the market. The team behind Friday the 13th: The Game shares that same approach and that attention to detail comes through as soon as you load up the game. It was a no-brainer for us to collaborate with them and include a Part 3 mask with their Ultimate Slasher Collector’s Edition. - Randy Falk, Director at NECA

We are very excited to be working with Gun Media and NECA to bring these amazing physical collections to one of the most loyal fanbases. The Ultimate Slasher Editions represent the definitive versions of the game and the Collector’s Edition includes a mask that is sure to be the centerpiece of every serious fan’s collection. - Joseph Sutton, President of Nighthawk Interactive
