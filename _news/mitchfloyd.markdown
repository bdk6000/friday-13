Camp Crystal Lake's roster of counselors is growing! We're happy to announce the addition of the newest, chill dude that's looking to spend a couple of hours alone each day at camp to really take in the scenery, get one with nature and enjoy all that grass on the lawn at camp. 

Here you can check out a bit of what makes Mitch tick, as he's coming to camp on Friday the 13th, this October!
