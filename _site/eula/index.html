                            	<p>Updated Version: July 25, 2017</p>

<h4 id="12-arbitration">12. Arbitration.</h4>

<p><strong>(b) Binding Arbitration</strong>. Any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (each, a “Claim”) by either you or GMH (except as otherwise provided in Section 12(d)) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 12(a) and the JAMS Rules, the terms in the JAMS Rules will control and prevail.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise set forth in Section 12(d), you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and GMH may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.
BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND GMH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</p>

<p><strong>(c) Location</strong>. The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify GMH in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of GMH’ arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Lexington, Kentucky, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America, and you and GMH agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

<p><strong>(d) Limitations</strong>. You and GMH agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between GMH and you individually. YOU AND GMH AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW: (I) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (II) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (III) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.</p>

<p><strong>(e) Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration</strong>. You and GMH agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or GMH’s intellectual property rights; and (ii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>(f) Governing Law</strong>. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement is governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of Kentucky, without regard to choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Software from outside of the United States. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

<p><strong>(g) Severability</strong>. You and GMH agree that if any portion this Section 12 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 12(d)), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 12(d) is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor GMH will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 12(d) found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America, and you and GMH agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

<h4 id="13-general-provisions">13. General Provisions.</h4>

<p>GMH reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement. GMH may modify this Agreement at any time by providing such revised Agreement to you or posting the revised Agreement on its website located at www.f13game.com. Your continued use of the Software shall constitute your acceptance of such revised Agreement. You may not assign this Agreement or any rights hereunder. Nothing in this Agreement shall constitute a partnership, agency or joint venture between you and GMH. Should any term or provision of this Agreement be deemed invalid, void or unenforceable either in its entirety or in a particular application, the remainder of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of GMH at any time or times to require performance of any provision of this Agreement shall in no manner affect its right at a later time to enforce the same unless the same is waived in writing. The terms set forth in this Agreement constitute the final, complete and exclusive agreement with respect to the Software and may not be contradicted, explained or supplemented by evidence of any prior agreement, any contemporaneous oral agreement or any consistent additional terms. GMH may, at its sole discretion, assign this Agreement without giving prior notice.</p>

<p>YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTAND THE RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS, TERMS AND CONDITIONS SET FORTH HEREIN. BY CONTINUING TO INSTALL THE SOFTWARE, YOU EXPRESSLY CONSENT TO BE BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND GRANT TO GMH THE RIGHTS SET FORTH HEREIN.</p>
