Such changes will be effective with or without prior notice to you. You can review the most current version of this Agreement by clicking on the “Terms of Use” link located at the bottom of the Site.

Such links do not imply endorsement by GMH of information or material on any other site, and GMH disclaims all liability with regard to your access to and use of such linked websites.</p>

<p>Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of GMH shall be limited to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.</p>

<h4 id="13-equitable-remedies">13. EQUITABLE REMEDIES</h4>

<p>You hereby acknowledge and agree that GMH would suffer irreparable harm if this Agreement were not specifically enforced. Consequently, in addition to such monetary and other relief as may be recoverable at law, you agree that GMH shall be entitled to specific performance or other injunctive relief, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, as remedy for any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement. Additionally, in the event any legal or administrative action or proceeding is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement and consistent with Section 14 below, the prevailing party in such action or proceeding shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party as the result of the action or proceeding.</p>

<h4 id="14-arbitration">14. ARBITRATION</h4>

<p><strong>A.  Binding Arbitration.</strong> Any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (each, a “<strong>Claim</strong>”) by either you or GMH (except as otherwise provided in Section 14.D) shall be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to the other party. Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS that are in effect at the time the arbitration is initiated (the “<strong>JAMS Rules</strong>”) and under the terms set forth in this Agreement. In the event of a conflict between the terms set forth in this Section 14.D and the JAMS Rules, the terms in the JAMS Rules will control and prevail.</p>

<p>Except as otherwise set forth in Section 14.D, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and we will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based. The determination of whether a Claim is subject to arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and determined by a court rather than an arbitrator. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, (i) you and GMH may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator; and (ii) the arbitrator’s decision is final, binding on all parties and enforceable in any court that has jurisdiction, provided that any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to follow applicable law.</p>

<p>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND GMH ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.</p>

<p><strong>B. Location.</strong> The arbitration will take place in your hometown area if you so notify GMH in your notice of arbitration or within ten (10) days following receipt of GMH’s arbitration notice. In the absence of a notice to conduct the arbitration in your hometown area, the arbitration will be conducted in Lexington, Kentucky, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. Any Claim not subject to arbitration (other than claims proceeding in any small claims court), or where no election to arbitrate has been made, shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction in Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America, and you and GMH agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

<p><strong>C. Limitations.</strong> You and GMH agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Claim between GMH and you individually. YOU AND GMH AGREE THAT, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW: (I) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS-ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (II) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (III) NO ARBITRATION SHALL BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER.</p>

<p><strong>D. Exceptions to Negotiations and Arbitration.</strong> You and GMH agree that the following Claims are not subject to the above provisions concerning negotiations and binding arbitration: (i) any Claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or GMH’s intellectual property rights; and (ii) any claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims court for Claims that are within the scope of such courts’ jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.</p>

<p><strong>F. Governing Law.</strong> Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this Agreement is governed by, and will be construed under, the laws of the United States of America and the law of the State of Kentucky, without regard to choice of law principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Other laws may apply if you choose to access the Software from outside of the United States. In such an event, those local laws shall affect this Agreement only to the extent necessary in that jurisdiction and this Agreement shall be interpreted to give maximum effect to the terms and conditions in this Agreement. You are responsible for compliance with all local laws if and to the extent local laws are applicable.</p>

<p><strong>G. Severability.</strong> You and GMH agree that if any portion this Section 14 is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of Section 14.D), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If Section 14.D is found to be illegal or unenforceable then neither you nor GMH will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of Section 14.D found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within Lexington, Kentucky, United States of America, and you and GMH agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

<h4 id="15-termination">15. TERMINATION</h4>

<p>This Agreement (and all subsequent modifications, if any) shall remain effective until terminated. Both you and GMH may terminate this Agreement at any time for any reason or for no reason. Termination by GMH will be effective upon notice to you, termination or deletion of your Account, or its decision to permanently discontinue offering and/or supporting the Game, which it may do at any time in its sole discretion. You may terminate this Agreement at any time simply by not using the Site or the Game.

<h4 id="16-miscellaneous">16. MISCELLANEOUS</h4>

<p><strong>A. Assignment.</strong> GMH may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign the Agreement without GMH’s prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment by you shall be null and void.</p>

<p><strong>C. Entire Agreement.</strong> This Agreement represents the complete agreement between you and GMH concerning the Site, the Game, and the subject matter of the Agreement, and supersedes any prior or contemporaneous agreements between you and GMH; provided however that this Agreement shall coexist with, and shall not supersede, the EULA, Code of Conduct or the Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>D. Force Majeure.</strong> GMH shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of GMH, including, without limitation, any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond GMH’s control such as acts of god, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.</p>

<p><strong>E. Location.</strong> The Site and the Game are operated by GMH in the United States. Those who choose to access the Site and/or the Game from locations outside the United States do so on their own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.

<p><strong>F. No Partnership.</strong> You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and GMH as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Site or the Game.</p>

<p><strong>G. No Waiver.</strong> GMH’s failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce each and every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by GMH of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.</p>

<p><strong>H. Notices.</strong> Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all notices given by you or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to: Gun Media Holdings, Inc., 838 E High Street, #308, Lexington, KY 40502.</p>

<p><strong>I. Reform and Severability.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such provision shall be reformed to the extent necessary to make it enforceable to the maximum extent permissible so as to affect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. If, however, it is determined that such provision cannot be reformed, then that provision shall be deemed severable from these terms and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>

<p><strong>J. Section Headings.</strong> The section headings used herein are for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of this Agreement or have any other legal effect.</p>

<p><strong>K. Survival.</strong> The provisions of Sections 4, 5-7, 10-14, and 16 shall survive any termination of this Agreement</p>

<p><strong>YOU HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND THE FOREGOING TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE PROPERTIES IS AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF YOUR AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.</strong></p>
