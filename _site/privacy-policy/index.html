                            	<p>Effective Date: May 24th 2017</p>

<h4 id="introduction">INTRODUCTION</h4>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Gun Media Holdings, Inc. (“<strong>GMH</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>” or “<strong>our</strong>”) collects, uses, and shares information about you and applies to your use of any online service location, including our websites, apps, and games, that posts a link to this Privacy Policy and all features, content, and other services that we own, control and make available through such online service location (collectively, the “Service”). This Privacy Policy does not apply to our information collection activities outside of the Service (unless otherwise stated below or at the time of collection) or the information collection activities of third parties, such as third party platform providers.</p>

<p>By using the Service, you agree to our <a href="/terms-of-use">Terms of Use</a> and to our collection, use and disclosure practices, and other activities as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree and consent, discontinue use of the Service.</p>

<h4 id="information-collection">INFORMATION COLLECTION</h4>

<h5 id="information-you-provide">Information You Provide</h5>

<p>We and our Service Providers (defined below) may collect information you provide directly via the Service. For example, we collect information when you register an account with us, post in our forums, play our games, access our in-game lobbies, communicate with us or other users, or transact with us through the Service.</p>

<p>The information we collect may include Personal Information. “<strong>Personal Information</strong>” is information that identifies you personally (whether alone or in combination), such as your first and last name, email address, display name, gender, and date of birth. You may choose to voluntarily submit certain other information to us through the Service, including Personal Information, but you are solely responsible for your own Personal Information in instances where we have not requested that you submit such information to us.</p>

<p>Certain areas of the Service, such as our forums and user profiles, and are designed to help you share information with the world. If you make information public through our Service, including through in-game communications and use, other users will have access to it and it will not be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. Please think carefully before making information public. You are solely responsible for information you make public. California minors have additional rights as set forth in “Your California Privacy Rights” below.</p>

<p>Personal Information once “<strong>de-identified</strong>” is not subject to this Privacy Policy and we and our Service Providers may treat it as non-Personal Information and use it without obligation to you except as prohibited by applicable law.</p>

<h5 id="information-collected-automatically">Information Collected Automatically</h5>

<p>We and our Service Providers may automatically collect certain information about you when you access or use the Service (“Usage Information”). Usage Information may include IP address, device identifier, browser type, operating system, data regarding network connected hardware, and other information about your use of the Service. To the extent that we combine Usage Information with your Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>The methods that may be used on the Service to collect Usage Information include:</p>

<p><strong>Log Files:</strong> Log files may record and store your Usage Information.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collected by Tracking Technologies:</strong> Cookies, web beacons (also known as “tracking pixels”), embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, device fingerprinting, in-app/game tracking methods, and other tracking technologies now and hereafter developed (“<strong>Tracking Technologies</strong>”) may be used to collect information about your interactions with the Service or emails, including information about your browsing and activity behavior.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cookies</strong><br />
A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s device, which may be a session ID cookie or tracking cookie. Session cookies make it easier for you to navigate the Service and expire when you close your browser. Tracking cookies help in understanding how you use the Service, and remain longer. The Service may associate some or all of these types of cookies with your devices. Cookies may remain on your device for extended periods of time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Web Beacons (“Tracking Pixels”)</strong><br />
Web beacons are small graphic images, also known as “internet tags” or “clear gifs,” embedded in web pages and email messages. Web beacons may be used to count the number of visitors to the Service, to monitor how users navigate the Service, and to count content views.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Embedded Scripts</strong><br />
An embedded script is programming code designed to collect information about your interactions with the Service. It is temporarily downloaded onto your device from our web server or a third party with whom we work, is active only while you are connected to the Service, and deleted or deactivated thereafter.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Location-identifying Technologies</strong><br />
GPS (global positioning systems) software, geo-filtering, and other location-aware technologies locate (sometimes precisely) you for purposes such as verifying your location and delivering or restricting relevant content based on your location.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Device Fingerprinting</strong>.<br />
Device fingerprinting is the process of analyzing and combining sets of information elements from your device’s browser, such as JavaScript objects and installed fonts, in order to create a “fingerprint” of your device and uniquely identify your device and applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>In-App/Game Tracking Methods</strong>.<br />
There are a variety of tracking technologies that may be included in apps and games, and these are not browser-based like cookies and cannot be controlled by browser settings. Some use device identifier, or other identifiers such as “Ad IDs” to associate app user activity to a particular app/game and to track user activity across apps/games.
Some information about your use of the Service and certain Third Party Services (defined below) may be collected using Tracking Technologies across time and services and used by us and third parties for purposes such as to associate different devices you use, and deliver relevant ads and/or other content to you on the Service and certain Third Party Services.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>For further information on Tracking Technologies and your choices regarding them, please see “Third Party Services, Features, and Devices” and “Your Rights and Choices” below.</p>

<h5 id="information-from-other-sources">Information from Other Sources</h5>

<p>We may obtain information about you from other sources, including Service Providers and Third Party Services, and combine such information with information we have collected about you. For example, we may obtain information from third party platform providers, such as Microsoft, Sony, and Valve, and their affiliates, about your use of our games on their platforms. To the extent we combine such third party sourced information with Personal Information we have collected about you on the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the accuracy of any information provided by third parties or third party policies or practices.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong>. We may share information about you with our agents, vendors, consultants, or other service providers (“<strong>Service Providers</strong>”) in connection with their work on our behalf. For example, we may engage Service Providers to operate or host parts of the Service, provide services related to the online components of our apps and games, fulfill your product orders, assist with our Promotions (defined below), or provide analytics or marketing services. These Service Providers are prohibited from using your Personal Information for any purpose other than to provide this assistance, although we may permit them to use aggregate information which does not identify you or de-identified data for other purposes. European residents have certain rights set out in “Your European Privacy Rights” below.</p>

<p><strong>Publishers, Platforms, and Retailers</strong>. We may share information about you with third party publishers, third party platform providers, such as Microsoft, Sony, Valve, and Twitch, and third party retailers, and their affiliates, in connection with providing you with our Service and facilitating your requests.</p>

<p><strong>Protection of Rights</strong>.

<p>Without limiting the foregoing, in our sole discretion, we may share aggregated information which does not identify you or de-identified information about you with third parties or affiliates for any purpose.</p>

<h4 id="sweepstakes-contests-and-promotions">SWEEPSTAKES, CONTESTS, AND PROMOTIONS</h4>

<p>We may offer sweepstakes, contests, surveys, and other promotions (each, a “<strong>Promotion</strong>”) jointly sponsored or offered by third parties that may require submitting Personal Information. If you voluntarily choose to enter a Promotion, your Personal Information may be disclosed to third parties for administrative purposes and as required by law (e.g., on a winners list). By entering, you agree to the official rules that govern that Promotion, and may, except where prohibited by applicable law, allow the sponsor and/or other parties to use your name, voice and/or likeness in advertising or marketing materials.</p>

<h4 id="third-party-services-features-and-devices">THIRD PARTY SERVICES, FEATURES, AND DEVICES</h4>

<p>Our Service contains content from and hyperlinks to websites, locations, platforms, and services operated and owned by third parties (“<strong>Third Party Services</strong>”). In addition, our Service contains features that allow you interact with, connect to, or access our Service through certain Third Party Services and third party devices (“<strong>Third Party Features</strong>”). For example, you use a Third Party Feature when you “like” or “share” content over social media through our Service, play our games on third party platforms and/or devices such as Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Steam, or broadcast your videos over third party video platforms, such as Twitch. Remember that third parties may use Tracking Technologies to independently collect information about you and may solicit Personal Information from you. Also, if you use a Third Party Feature, both we and the applicable third party may have access to and use information associated with your use of the Third Party Feature.</p>

<p>Our Service also contains Tracking Technologies operated by third parties. For example, analytics services, such as Google Analytics, may use Tracking Technologies on our Service to help us analyze your use of the Service, compile statistic reports on the Service’s activity, and provide other services relating to Service activity and internet usage. Similarly, ad serving services, advertisers, and other third parties may use Tracking Technologies on our Service and Third Party Services to track your activities across time and services, and tailor ads to you based on your activities, which may include sending you an ad on a Third Party Service or third party device after you have left the Service (“<strong>Interest-based Advertising</strong>”).</p>

<p>The information collected and stored by third parties, whether through our Service, a Third Party Service, a Third Party Feature, or a third party device, remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We are not responsible for and make no representations regarding third party policies and practices, and encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use. To the extent we combine information we receive from third parties with Personal Information we collect directly from you on the Service, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h4 id="your-rights-and-choices">YOUR RIGHTS AND CHOICES</h4>

<h5 id="accessing-your-information">Accessing Your Information.</h5>

<p>You have the right to access Personal Information that you have voluntarily submitted to us through the Service, including correcting, updating, or removing that information, by sending an email to us here. We may require additional information from you to allow us to confirm your identity. Please note that we will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

<h5 id="tracking-technologies-generally">Tracking Technologies Generally</h5>

<p>Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some instances blocked in the future by selecting certain settings. Browsers offer different functionalities and options so you may need to set them separately. With respect to our apps, you can stop all collection of information via the app by uninstalling the app. Also, you may be able to exercise specific privacy choices, such as enabling or disabling certain location-based services, by adjusting the permissions in your device.</p>

<p>Please be aware that if you disable or remove these technologies some parts of the Service may not work and that when you revisit the Service your ability to limit browser-based Tracking Technologies is subject to your browser settings and limitations.</p>

<p>Your browser settings may allow you to automatically transmit a “Do Not Track” signal to online services you visit. Note, however, there is no industry consensus as to what website and app operators should do with regard to these signals. Accordingly, we do not monitor or take any action with respect to these “Do Not Track” signals or other mechanisms. For more information on “Do Not Track,” visit http://www.allaboutdnt.com.</p>

<h5 id="analytics-and-advertising-tracking-technologies">Analytics and Advertising Tracking Technologies</h5>

<p>You may exercise choices regarding the use of cookies from Google Analytics by going to https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout or downloading the Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>

<p>You may choose whether to receive Interest-based Advertising by submitting opt-outs. Some of the advertisers and Service Providers that perform advertising-related services for us and our partners may participate in the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”) Self-Regulatory Program for Online Behavioral Advertising. To learn more about how you can exercise certain choices regarding Interest-based Advertising, visit http://www.aboutads.info/choices, and http://www.aboutads.info/appchoices for information on the DAA’s opt-out program for apps. Some of these companies may also be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”). To learn more about the NAI and your opt-out options for their members, see http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/. Please be aware that, even if you are able to opt-out of certain kinds of Interest-based Advertising, you may continue to receive other types of ads. Opting out only means that those selected members should no longer deliver certain Interest-based Advertising to you, but does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content and/or ads (e.g., from other ad networks). GMH is not responsible for effectiveness of, or compliance with, any third-parties’ opt-out options or programs or the accuracy of their statements regarding their programs.</p>

<h5 id="communications">Communications</h5>

<p>You may opt-out of receiving marketing emails from us at any time by following the instructions as provided in marketing emails to click on the unsubscribe link or by sending an email to us here with the word UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject field of the email.

<p>We may send you push notifications until you remove our apps or games or opt-out by adjusting the permissions on your device.</p>

<h5 id="your-california-privacy-rights">Your California Privacy Rights</h5>

<p>California’s “Shine the Light” law permits customers in California to request certain details about how certain types of their information are shared with third parties and, in some cases, affiliates, for those third parties’ and affiliates’ own direct marketing purposes.
