- Fixed cause of some random mid-game freeze crashes.
- Fixed a memory leak for dedicated servers.
- Forbidding Hunter (Tommy Jarvis) counselor selections.
- Fixed an exploit with crouching back into objects.
- Fixed some achievements not unlocking when playing on dedicated servers.

This should end the Packanack Lodge roof glitch, various map escapes that have been found and you should see far less crashing now that we've localized the major memory leak issues. These updates will be happening for consoles relatively soon, but this should help with those that are getting connection issues.
