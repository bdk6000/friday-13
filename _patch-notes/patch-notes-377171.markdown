* FIXED - Various issues with cooldown speed and timings for Jason's Abilities (Shift, Sense, etc).
    * Cooldown for Abilities was drastically shortened.
    * Unlock timings for Abilities were off, and Abilities would unlock too closely together.
* FIXED - Counselor Animation Interrupt
    * Counselors were able to interrupt animations with key/button presses such as Combat Stance, and similar.
    * This resulted in unintended behavior with counselors jumping from windows etc.
