<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:40px;"><strong>Tommy Jarvis 2.0 (and Jarvis Tapes!)</strong></span></h3>
<p><a title="Hero Jarvis" href="/uploads/HeroJarvis.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/uploads/HeroJarvis.jpg" alt="Hero Jarvis" width="760" /></a></p>
Tommy Jarvis has had a pep talk and now has the courage and determination to protect all the Counselors of Camp Crystal lake. In this update, we tried to clear define what it means to play as Tommy Jarvis. Players chosen as Jarvis should prioritize saving the other Counselors from Jason and helping them escape. To emphasize Tommy’s hero attributes and goals, we have introduced these following changes:

* Tommy Jarvis no longer says a variant of “I need to get out of here” when he spawns 
* The text that displays when Tommy Jarvis spawns has been changed from “Escape!” to “YOU were chosen to be Tommy Jarvis” - “**Save the other counselors!**” 
* Tommy Jarvis is no longer startled by dead bodies
* Tommy Jarvis spawns with a Medical Spray **and** a Pocket Knife

To incentivise these new character goals and discourage Jarvis players from escaping on their own, XP will be granted to Jarvis for sacrificing himself while there are any living Counselors nearby (20 meters). This is a one time bonus per match. The bonus will not be granted multiple times for multiple Counselors in the vicinity. Any deaths caused by Jason will grant XP - this includes death by traps. Deaths due to suicide or team kills are excluded from the bonus XP.
We have also added an additional post round reward screen to show XP gained while playing as Tommy Jarvis. This will be shown after the normal Counselor reward screen.

<h4 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:25px;"><strong>Jarvis Tapes have been added!</strong></span></h4>
---
<p style="text-align: center;">Tommy Jarvis Tapes have also been added alongside the TJ 2.0 update. These are collected in the same way as the Pamela tapes and there are 13 Jarvis tapes in total.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Good Luck!</p>

<p><a title="Jarvis Tape" href="/uploads/JarvisTape2.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/uploads/JarvisTape2.jpg" alt="Jarvis Tape" width="760" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:40px;"><strong>New Environmental kills</strong></span></h3>

<p style="text-align: left;">5 New environmental kills have been added to Jason's arsenal! These kills are available on every single available map and can be executed by all the Jason variants. This should spice things up a bit on Camp Crystal Lake! Counselors will need to be extra careful, as Jason is now able to use these following household items as environmental kills:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Stove Top</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Boom Box</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Kitchen Knife (Throat Slit)</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Kitchen Knife (Stab)</h4>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">Screw Driver</h4>

<p><a title="Stove Top Kill" href="/uploads/EnvKillFaceBoil.jpg"><img style="float: left;" src="/uploads/EnvKillFaceBoil.jpg" width="375" /></a><a title="Boom Box Kill" href="/uploads/EnvKillBoomBox.jpg"><img style="float: right;" src="/uploads/EnvKillBoomBox.jpg" width="375" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Kitchen Knife Throat Slit Kill" href="/uploads/EnvKillThroatSlit.jpg"><img style="float: left;" src="/uploads/EnvKillThroatSlit.jpg" width="375" /></a><a title="Kitchen Knife Stab Kill" href="/uploads/EnvKillSuperStab.jpg"><img style="float: right;" src="/uploads/EnvKillSuperStab.jpg" width="375" /></a></p>
<p><a title="Screwdriver kill" href="/uploads/EnvKillScrewDriver.jpg"><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="/uploads/EnvKillScrewDriver.jpg" alt="Screwdriver kill" width="760" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size:40px;"><strong>Changes</strong></span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="left">Jason and Disconnecting Counselors</h4>
---
<p>&nbsp;</p>
* Jason will now properly receive the kill credit even if a counselor disconnects during the kill animation 

  *`"No words are needed for this change."`*
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="left">Counselors are now able to check their map to find the location of Repair Parts that have been dropped</h4>
---
<p>&nbsp;</p>
* Repair parts that have been dropped will now immediately show up as an icon on all available Counselor maps. These icons will not appear on items that have not yet been picked up or on items currently being held. Jason is unable to see these icons on his map. If a Counselor escapes with a repair part or dies with it in the water, the item will respawn somewhere else on the map with an icon accompanying it.

  *`"It was frustrating in the later stages of a match for Counselors when repair parts were taken from their spawns and lost in a large map. Being able to locate your win condition is an important part of the game and this QoL change should help alleviate some issues"`* 
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="left">Jason's Grab adjustments</h4>
---
<p>&nbsp;</p>
* Slightly reduced the maximum range of Jason's Grab
* Reduced the cone size of Jason's Grab

  *`"This is a change that we have been looking into for a while. Through internal testing, we have decided that these new values currently feel better than they did previously. We will be keeping a close eye on community feedback regarding this change and are not opposed to making further adjustments in the future."`*

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="left">Emote and Scoreboard key mapping changed on controllers</h4>
---
<p>&nbsp;</p>
* The Emote Wheel is now accessible by **holding down** the [Y]/[Triangle] button on controllers

* Pressing [UP] on the D-Pad brings up the Scoreboard as it did originally

  *`“This is just a much more convenient button to access the scoreboard. The button to activate the sweater remains the same”`*

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
