The latest patch is rolling out! We are also happy to announce that this update also includes the new Spring Break 1984 DLC. 

The biggest additions are the new interface for clothing selection; we've tried to make things a bit easier to work with in terms of selecting your clothing and color styles! 

Of course; we've also added in the new communication emotes! You can choose between a ton of them, all free and usable with every counselor in the game! 

Without further adieu;

New Stuff
New Outfit Customization!
