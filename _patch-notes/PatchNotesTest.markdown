### New Features

**Rain**

* The Rain feature is now available and players may have a chance to encounter this new weather in any of the current playable maps.

**Counselors pushing**

* Counselors are now able to “push” other counselors
        * "In order to prevent players from griefing via “bodyblocking”, we have introduced a new feature that allows Counselors to push each other. The player being pushed will slowly walk away in the direction opposite of the player pushing. This feature does not affect Jason."

**Changes**

* Thick Skinned perk changes
    * Thick Skinned now reduces ALL damage
>Originally, Thick Skinned was intended to reduce damage specifically from 
>Jason's’ attacks. However, there was a bug that was causing Thick Skinned to apply  >twice which in turn also caused the perk to incorrectly reduce all incoming damage.  >This issue was fixed in the last patch. After considering our internal testing and >community feedback, we agreed that the previous iteration of Thick Skinned worked >better for game balance when the inflated damage reduction values were no longer >present. 
    * The tooltip for Thick Skinned has been changed from “Take less damage from all incoming attacks.” to “Take less damage.“

    * Jason’s Stun Duration timer has been adjusted

    * Reduced the effectiveness of the Grease Monkey perk
