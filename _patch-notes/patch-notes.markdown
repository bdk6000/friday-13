<h3 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:45px;"><strong>Legendary Perks & Perk Changes</strong></span></h3>


<h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:45px;"><strong>Legendary Perks & Perk Changes</strong></span></h2>

A new perk rarity tier has been introduced! Legendary perks!
Legendary perks are now the rarest perks that can be obtained.
The perk values and traits are identical to Epic perks, but there is one big difference between the two rarities.
All Legendary perks come equipped with one extra positive trait!
These traits are predetermined and work in addition to the perkâ€™s original traits.
Here are the traits that are tied to each Legendary perk:
