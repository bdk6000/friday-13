<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:30px;"><strong>Legendary Perks & Perk Changes</strong></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:23px;">Legendary Perks</span></h4>

A new perk rarity tier has been introduced! Legendary perks!

Legendary perks are now the rarest perks that can be obtained.
The perk values and traits are identical to Epic perks, but there is one big difference between the two rarities.
All Legendary perks come equipped with one extra positive trait!
These traits are predetermined and work in addition to the perk’s original traits.
Here are the traits that are tied to each Legendary perk:

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:23px;">Perk Values Adjusted</span></h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:23px;">Perk Selection Screen Updated</span></h4>

Perk rarity can now also be distinguished by a numbering system added to the perk graphic in order to assist players with color blindness




<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:35px;"><strong>Combat Update</strong></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:23px;">Weapon Swapping Feature</span></h4>

A new option is now available in the Jason selection screen! 
Players will now be able to equip different weapons on each Jason.
This feature unlocks for players at level 113 and will allow the swapping of the following weapons:

* Pickaxe
* Machete
* Axe
* Fire Axe
* Battle Axe
* Spear
* Pig Splitter
* Shears

All the grab kills tied to the weapons (including the DLC kills) will also be available through the swap.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:23px;">Jason’s Swing Animation</span></h4>

All of Jason’s weapons have had their swinging animations adjusted to swing lower towards the ground. 
This change should help prevent Jason’s swings from missing players that are on uneven terrain or crouching.




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:23px;">Jason’s Grab Changes</span></h4>

Jason’s grab has been updated with a new animation and sound effect. 
These change should more accurately represent the distance of Jason’s grab and also feel more gratifying when landing a grab on a counselor.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:23px;">Doorway Combat Changes</span></h4>

We have made some adjustments to the way that combat works when there is a door in between Jason and a counselor. Originally, players were able to initiate combat from both sides of a closed door. This allowed counselors to time their swings and safely interrupt/damage Jason during his process of breaking down the door. Because of the way that combat works, there was little counterplay to these occurrences. In order to combat this one-sided exchange, counselors will no longer be able to hit Jason through doors. However, Jason will still have the ability to damage counselors that are standing too close to the door.




<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:23px;"><strong>Counselor Weapon Stats Adjusted</strong></span></h4>


The pips that represent the weapon stats in the How to Play section have had their values per pip adjusted to be more consistent.
The following weapons have had their stats adjusted.

* 2X4
* Frying Pan
* Fallen Tree Branch
* Baseball Bat
* Metal Pipe
* Wrench
* Cooking Pot

<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h1 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:35px;"><strong>Matchmaking Changes</strong></span></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:23px;">Infraction System</span></h4>


An infraction system has been added in order to combat issues with players prematurely leaving matches.
Players will now gain infraction points by performing any of the following actions in a Quickplay match:

* Leaving the match as Jason
* Leaving the match as the Host
* Leaving the match while still alive as a Counselor
* Leaving the match while in the process of being killed

Accumulating too many infractions points will place you in a low priority queue in matchmaking with other similar players. These Infraction points are not permanent and will decay over time. For more information about this system, please visit our official forums.





<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:23px;">Spawn Preference System</span></h4>

In the December patch of last year, we introduced a "ticketing" system to the Spawn Preferences to combat some of the issues players were having with the Jason selection process. To improve on this system, we have made multiple changes to the Spawn Preferences this patch. The most noteworthy improvement is that this system is now tied to each individual player’s account. This means that a player’s chance to be selected as Jason will now persist even after changing lobbies. In addition, we have also made adjustments to the values in the preference system in order to provide players a fairer distribution of chances to become Jason. 

The probability of a player being chosen as Jason is affected by their preference settings and also their recent amount of Jason games. Playing as Jason too many times in a small timeframe will cause the player to no longer be considered as a candidate to play as Jason. However, the player’s chance to be selected as Jason rapidly “recharges” over time and this system will have no long lasting effects on players. 
For more information about this system, please visit our official forums.

The Spawn Preference system only affects Private Matches only when a Jason has not been picked manually.
